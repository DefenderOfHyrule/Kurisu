Your "hekate_ipl.ini" file should be updated. You can download a new one [here](https://nintendohomebrew.com/assets/hekate_ipl.ini) to replace the one that is currently in your bootloader folder.

**Note**: This hekate_ipl.ini configuration only works from hekate 6.3.0 and onwards, so make sure you are using hekate 6.3.0+ found [here](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases).
